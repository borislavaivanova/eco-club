# CSS Migration Complete

The styles have been migrated from style-guide.css to a modular structure:

/styles
├── main.css           # Main entry point that imports all other styles
├── variables.css      # CSS variables and custom properties
├── typography.css     # Typography and text styles
├── components.css     # Reusable components (buttons, cards, etc.)
├── layout.css         # Layout utilities and responsive styles
└── sections.css       # Section-specific styles

The original style-guide.css can be safely removed.

Benefits of the new structure:
1. Better organization and maintainability
2. Modular and reusable components
3. Clearer separation of concerns
4. Easier debugging and updates
5. Improved performance through selective loading
6. Better collaboration support

To use the new styles, simply import main.css which handles importing all other required stylesheets.
